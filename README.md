Cross Platform File Manager

This will be a competitor to FileZilla, there are multiple common sense tickets that have been open over years, if not a decade.  Like this one asking for a simple confirmation when you are about to move folders in the remote pane:

Or this one (which is a good representation of what is going on), asking to provide an option to stop prompting you to upload files
